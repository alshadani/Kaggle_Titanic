# Kaggle_Titanic
My solution to the Kaggle Titanic competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic

From this competition I learned. 

### Understanding the Problem.

### Exploring the Data.

### Data Preprocessing.

Handling missing values by imputing or removing them based on the nature of the data.
Converting categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalizing or scale numerical features as needed.

### Feature Engineering:
Creating new features or modify existing ones that might enhance the model's performance.

### Model Selection:
Choosing suitable machine learning algorithms for my problem.

### Model Training:
Training my selected models on the training set.
Hyperparameters tuning to improve model performance. 

### Model Evaluation:
Evaluating my model on the validation set using appropriate metrics.
Using cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of my model's performance.

My final score is 0.78947. Which is 1472 out of 15380 contantans.
Which is in the top 10% of all contantans.
